# Computer Vision Anki Decks Collection

A curated collection of spaced repetition flashcards for mastering fundamental concepts in Computer Vision, designed specifically for graduate students and practitioners.

## Overview

This collection contains three comprehensive Anki decks covering essential computer vision topics:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** - 46 cards covering core CNN concepts
- **Face Recognition** - 45 cards exploring face recognition fundamentals  
- **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** - 41 cards introducing transformer architectures for vision

All decks have been carefully revised and optimized for effective learning through spaced repetition, with a focus on conceptual understanding over memorization of implementation details.

## Deck Contents

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
**File:** `final-revised-cnn-deck-20-aug-2025.tsv`

Covers fundamental CNN concepts including:
- Convolution operations and receptive fields
- Pooling strategies and their trade-offs
- Architecture evolution (LeNet → AlexNet → VGG → ResNet → Inception)
- Training challenges (vanishing gradients, overfitting)
- Batch normalization and regularization techniques
- Modern CNN design principles

### Face Recognition
**File:** `revised-fr-deck-20-aug-2025.tsv`

Explores face recognition fundamentals including:
- Verification vs identification concepts
- Embedding spaces and similarity metrics
- Evaluation protocols and benchmarks
- Modern loss functions (triplet loss, ArcFace, center loss)
- Challenges in cross-pose and cross-age recognition
- Bias and fairness considerations
- Template-based recognition systems

### Vision Transformers (ViTs)
**File:** `revised-vit-deck-20-aug-2025.tsv`

Introduces vision transformers including:
- ViT architecture components and image-to-sequence conversion
- Self-attention mechanisms and computational complexity
- Comparison with CNNs (inductive biases, data requirements)
- Training challenges and solutions
- Advanced concepts (CLIP, Swin Transformers, hybrid architectures)
- Practical deployment considerations

## Quick Start

### Installing Anki
1. Download Anki from [apps.ankiweb.net](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
2. Install and create an account (optional but recommended for syncing)

### Importing the Decks
1. Download the TSV files from this repository
2. Open Anki and click "Import File"
3. Select a TSV file and configure import settings:
   - **Field separator:** Tab
   - **Allow HTML in fields:** Yes
   - **Deck:** Create a new deck or select existing
4. Click "Import" and repeat for all three decks

### First Study Session
1. Select a deck from the main Anki screen
2. Click "Study Now" to begin your first session
3. Read each question carefully and try to recall the answer
4. Click "Show Answer" to reveal the explanation
5. Rate your confidence (Again/Hard/Good/Easy) to optimize future reviews

## Study Tips

- **Daily consistency** beats marathon sessions - aim for 15-20 minutes daily
- **Don't rush** - take time to understand each concept fully
- **Make connections** - link concepts across decks (e.g., attention in ViTs vs CNNs)
- **Apply knowledge** - try to relate cards to papers you're reading or projects you're working on
- **Review regularly** - trust Anki's spaced repetition algorithm

## Deck Statistics

| Deck | Cards | Avg. Answer Length | Topics Covered | Difficulty |
|------|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| CNNs | 46 | ~85 words | 15 major concepts | Beginner-Intermediate |
| Face Recognition | 45 | ~75 words | 12 major concepts | Intermediate |
| Vision Transformers | 41 | ~90 words | 14 major concepts | Intermediate-Advanced |

## FAQ

**Q: How long does it take to complete all decks?**
A: With consistent daily study (15-20 minutes).

**Q: Should I study all decks simultaneously?**
A: For beginners, sequential study (CNNs → Face Recognition → ViTs) works well. Advanced users can study in parallel.

**Q: How often should I review?**
A: Follow Anki's scheduling algorithm. Typically, you'll review new cards more frequently, with intervals increasing as you demonstrate mastery.
