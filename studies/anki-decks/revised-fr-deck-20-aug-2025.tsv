What is face verification?	Face verification answers "Are these two face images from the same person?" It's a binary decision where the system compares two face images and decides if they match or not. The system computes how similar the faces are and compares this similarity to a threshold to make the yes/no decision.
What is face identification?	Face identification answers "Who is this person?" from a database of known identities. The system compares a query face against all stored identities and finds the best match. Unlike verification's simple yes/no answer, identification must search through potentially thousands of known people.
Why is face identification computationally harder than verification?	Verification only needs one comparison between two faces, making it very fast. Identification must compare the query face against every person in the database, so it gets slower as the database grows larger. A database with a million people requires a million comparisons for each identification.
What is an embedding space in face recognition?	An embedding space is like a map where similar faces are placed close together and different faces are far apart. Face recognition systems learn to convert face images into points in this space, where the distance between points tells you how similar the faces are.
Why do modern face recognition systems normalize face embeddings?	Normalization places all face embeddings on the surface of a sphere, making comparisons based on direction rather than magnitude. This creates cleaner geometric relationships where the angle between two face vectors directly represents how similar the faces are, regardless of image brightness or contrast.
What is closed-set face recognition?	Closed-set recognition assumes every test face belongs to someone already in the training database. It's like a multiple-choice test where you know the answer must be one of the provided options. The system just needs to pick the best match from known identities.
What is open-set face recognition?	Open-set recognition must handle unknown people who weren't in the training data. It's like a test where "none of the above" is always an option. The system must decide not only who someone might be, but also whether they're a completely unknown person.
What makes open-set recognition challenging?	The system must balance two types of errors: accepting unknown people as known identities, or rejecting known people as unknown. Setting the decision boundary too loose lets strangers in, while setting it too strict locks out legitimate users. Finding the right balance is crucial for security applications.
Why is face alignment important?	Face alignment ensures all faces are positioned consistently before recognition. Without alignment, the same person's face might be rotated, scaled, or positioned differently, making them look like different people to the system. Alignment creates a standard pose that makes comparison fair and accurate.
How does landmark-based alignment work?	Landmark alignment identifies key facial points like eyes, nose, and mouth corners, then rotates and scales the image so these landmarks match a standard template. This ensures all faces have eyes in the same position and the same overall scale, creating consistent input for recognition.
What is TAR in face verification?	TAR (True Accept Rate) measures how often the system correctly accepts genuine matches. If you present 100 pairs of images from the same person, TAR tells you what percentage the system correctly identified as matches. Higher TAR means fewer legitimate users get rejected.
What is FAR in face verification?	FAR (False Accept Rate) measures how often the system incorrectly accepts impostor pairs as matches. If you present 100 pairs of images from different people, FAR tells you what percentage the system wrongly identified as the same person. Lower FAR means better security against imposters.
What is EER and why is it useful?	EER (Equal Error Rate) is the operating point where the system makes equal numbers of false accepts and false rejects. It provides a single number to compare different face recognition systems. A lower EER generally indicates better overall performance across different security requirements.
What do ROC curves show for face verification?	ROC curves plot the trade-off between correctly accepting genuine users and incorrectly accepting imposters. They show how system performance changes as you adjust the similarity threshold. A curve closer to the top-left corner indicates better performance across all operating points.
What do CMC curves show for face identification?	CMC curves show identification performance by plotting the percentage of correct identifications within the top-k matches. For example, it might show that 85% of people are correctly identified in the top-1 match, and 95% are found within the top-5 matches.
Why are IJB benchmarks more realistic than LFW?	IJB benchmarks use multiple images per person with extreme variations in lighting, pose, and image quality, better reflecting real-world conditions. They test both verification and identification in challenging scenarios that systems actually encounter in deployment, unlike controlled laboratory conditions.
What is domain shift in face recognition?	Domain shift occurs when a system trained on one type of data performs poorly on different data. For example, a system trained on high-quality photos might fail on surveillance camera images due to differences in lighting, resolution, and image quality between the training and deployment environments.
What causes dataset bias in face recognition?	Dataset bias occurs when training data doesn't represent the diversity of real-world users. This might include overrepresentation of certain ethnic groups, age ranges, or image conditions. Systems then perform better for groups that were well-represented in training and worse for underrepresented groups.
What is triplet loss and how does it work?	Triplet loss teaches the system that faces from the same person should be more similar than faces from different people. It uses three images: an anchor, a positive example (same person), and a negative example (different person), then adjusts the system to make the anchor closer to the positive than to the negative.
Why is triplet mining important?	Not all triplets are equally useful for learning. Easy triplets where the system already gets the answer right don't improve performance. Hard triplets where the system makes mistakes provide the most learning value. Mining finds these challenging examples that push the system to improve.
What is ArcFace's key innovation?	ArcFace uses angular margin in the embedding space, which creates more intuitive geometric relationships between face embeddings. The angular distance between face vectors corresponds directly to how similar the faces are, making the learning process more stable and interpretable than previous approaches.
What is Center Loss?	Center Loss encourages faces from the same person to cluster tightly around a central point in the embedding space. While regular classification loss ensures different identities are separable, Center Loss specifically makes faces from the same identity more compact, improving the quality of face embeddings.
What are sub-centers in face recognition?	Sub-centers allow each identity to have multiple cluster centers instead of just one. This helps handle label noise in training data - clean face images cluster around one center while noisy or mislabeled images form separate clusters. The system becomes more robust to imperfect training data.
Why is angular distance preferred over Euclidean distance?	Angular distance measures the angle between face vectors, focusing on their direction rather than magnitude. This makes comparisons more stable across different lighting conditions and image qualities. Two faces pointing in the same direction are considered similar regardless of image brightness or contrast.
How did DeepFace advance face recognition?	DeepFace was the first to show that deep neural networks could achieve human-level performance on face recognition. It demonstrated that with enough training data and computational power, CNNs could learn much better face representations than previous hand-crafted feature approaches.
What was FaceNet's approach to face recognition?	FaceNet learned face embeddings directly using triplet loss, without needing intermediate classification steps. It showed that you could train a system to produce good face embeddings by teaching it that similar faces should be close together and different faces should be far apart in embedding space.
How do Vision Transformers differ from CNNs for faces?	Vision Transformers use attention mechanisms that can focus on important facial features regardless of their location, while CNNs process local regions step by step. Transformers can better handle occlusions and unusual poses by attending to visible facial parts and ignoring obscured regions.
What is the core challenge in domain adaptation?	Domain adaptation addresses the problem that face recognition systems often fail when deployed in conditions different from their training environment. A system trained on high-quality studio photos might struggle with surveillance cameras due to different lighting, angles, and image quality.
What is few-shot face recognition?	Few-shot face recognition recognizes new identities from just a few example images. This is important for practical applications where you can't collect hundreds of photos of each person. The system must learn to generalize from limited examples to recognize that person in new conditions.
Why is metric learning suitable for few-shot recognition?	Metric learning teaches systems to measure similarity between faces rather than memorizing specific identities. This means the system can compare a new person's photo to just a few reference images and determine if they match, without needing extensive retraining for each new person.
What is template-based recognition?	Template-based recognition combines multiple images of the same person to create a more robust representation. Instead of relying on a single photo that might be blurry or poorly lit, the system uses several images to build a comprehensive profile that captures different aspects of that person's appearance.
How does template fusion improve recognition?	Template fusion reduces the impact of individual poor-quality images by combining information from multiple photos. If one image is blurry and another is well-lit, the fusion process can create a representation that captures the best aspects of both images, leading to more reliable recognition.
What makes large-scale recognition challenging?	As databases grow to millions of identities, finding the correct match becomes like finding a needle in a haystack. Small differences between people become harder to detect when you have so many options to choose from, and the computational cost of searching through enormous databases becomes a practical limitation.
How does racial bias manifest in face recognition?	Racial bias appears as significantly higher error rates for certain ethnic groups, often due to training datasets that contain more examples of some groups than others. Systems that work well for well-represented groups may struggle with underrepresented groups, creating unfair performance disparities.
What causes the "other-race effect" in face recognition?	The "other-race effect" occurs when systems trained primarily on one ethnic group become less effective at distinguishing between individuals from other ethnic groups. This happens because the training data doesn't provide enough diversity to learn the distinguishing features that matter across all ethnic groups.
Why are large batch sizes important for face recognition training?	Large batch sizes provide more negative examples for comparison during training. When learning to distinguish between people, having many different identities in each training batch gives the system more opportunities to learn what makes each person unique compared to others.
What is attention in face recognition?	Attention mechanisms help the system focus on the most important parts of a face for identification. Just as humans naturally look at eyes, nose, and mouth when recognizing faces, attention allows the system to emphasize discriminative facial regions while ignoring less important background areas.
How does multi-task learning benefit face recognition?	Multi-task learning trains the system to perform several related tasks simultaneously, such as identifying people, estimating age, and recognizing expressions. Learning these related tasks together often produces better face representations than focusing solely on identification, as the additional tasks provide complementary information.
What challenges exist in cross-pose face recognition?	Cross-pose recognition must handle dramatic appearance changes as faces rotate from frontal to profile views. Features that are clearly visible from the front may be hidden in profile, and the overall face shape appears very different, making it challenging to recognize the same person across different poses.
What is age progression in face recognition?	Age progression refers to the challenge of recognizing people as they age over time. Facial features change significantly over years or decades, and systems must learn to identify the underlying identity despite these natural aging changes. This is particularly important for long-term identification systems.
What is adversarial training for face recognition?	Adversarial training improves system robustness by including deliberately challenging examples during training. These examples are designed to fool the system, forcing it to learn more robust features that work even when someone tries to attack or deceive the recognition system.
How do GANs help with face recognition data?	GANs can generate synthetic face images to augment training datasets, particularly useful when you have limited real photos of certain people or groups. They can create additional training examples with different expressions, lighting, or poses, helping to improve system performance and reduce bias.
What is continual learning in face recognition?	Continual learning enables face recognition systems to learn new identities without forgetting previously learned ones. This is crucial for practical systems that need to add new users over time without requiring complete retraining on all existing users.
How does quality assessment improve template-based systems?	Quality assessment automatically identifies which images in a template are clear and well-lit versus blurry or poorly lit. By giving more weight to high-quality images during template fusion, the system can create more reliable representations and improve overall recognition accuracy.
What is neural architecture search for face recognition?	Neural architecture search automatically discovers optimal network designs for face recognition by testing many different architectural choices. This helps find architectures that balance recognition accuracy with computational efficiency for specific deployment requirements.
How do multi-modal biometric systems work?	Multi-modal systems combine face recognition with other biometric methods like fingerprints or iris scans. By using multiple types of biological information, these systems achieve higher accuracy and security than any single biometric method alone, as it becomes much harder to fool multiple systems simultaneously.
